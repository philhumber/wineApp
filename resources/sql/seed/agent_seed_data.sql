(1, 'Pinot Noir', 'Pinot Noir is a thin-skinned, early-ripening grape variety that thrives in cool to moderate climates and is known for its delicate, aromatic wines with high acidity and soft tannins. It is notoriously difficult to grow, as it is highly susceptible to disease, rot, and climate variation, requiring well-drained soils and careful vineyard management. Pinot Noir prefers limestone-rich or well-draining soils and flourishes in regions like Burgundy, Oregon, and New Zealand, where cooler temperatures allow for slow, even ripening, preserving its signature bright red fruit, floral, and earthy aromas. The grape''s thin skins and tight clusters make it vulnerable to botrytis and mildew, demanding meticulous canopy management to ensure airflow and sun exposure. Despite its challenges, Pinot Noir produces some of the world''s most elegant and terroir-expressive wines, known for their silky texture and complex aromatics.', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Grape_near_Sancerre.jpg'),
(2, 'Chardonnay', 'Chardonnay is a versatile, green-skinned grape variety that adapts well to a wide range of climates, making it one of the most widely planted white wine grapes in the world. It thrives in cool, moderate, and warm climates, expressing different characteristics depending on terroir and winemaking style. In cooler regions like Chablis and Champagne, Chardonnay retains high acidity and citrus-driven flavors, while in warmer climates like California and Australia, it develops richer, tropical fruit notes. The grape grows vigorously and is relatively resilient to disease, though it can be susceptible to frost in early budding regions. Chardonnay''s neutral flavor profile makes it an excellent canvas for winemaking techniques, including oak aging (adding vanilla and spice notes) and malolactic fermentation (bringing creamy, buttery textures).', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/Chardonnay.jpg'),
(3, 'Meunier', 'Meunier, often called Pinot Meunier, is a black-skinned grape variety primarily used in Champagne blends, though it is increasingly being recognized for its potential in single-varietal wines. It thrives in cool climates and is particularly valued for its hardiness and ability to withstand frost, making it an essential grape in the cool, northern vineyards of Champagne. Meunier is a mutant of Pinot Noir and shares some characteristics, but it buds later and ripens earlier, reducing the risk of spring frost damage. The grape''s name, meaning ''miller'' in French, comes from the white, powdery appearance of its leaves, which are covered in fine hairs. Meunier contributes softness, fruitiness, and approachability to Champagne, offering flavors of red berries, orchard fruit, and floral notes, often making wines that are more immediate and expressive in youth compared to Pinot Noir-based Champagnes.', 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/Pinot_Meunier.jpg');
