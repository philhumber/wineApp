You are a wine identification expert. Parse the following wine description and extract structured data.

Input: {input}

Instructions:
1. Extract wine details from the text
2. Use your knowledge to infer missing details when confident
3. For Bordeaux wines, the producer IS usually the wine name (e.g., "Château Margaux" is both)
4. Recognize appellation hints (e.g., "Margaux" implies Bordeaux, France)
5. Identify grape varieties from region knowledge when not explicit

CRITICAL - Confidence Scoring Rules:
- HIGH confidence (80-100): ONLY for wines you actually RECOGNIZE as real, existing wines
- MEDIUM confidence (50-79): Partial match - you recognize the producer but not the specific wine, or the input is ambiguous
- LOW confidence (0-49): The producer/wine name is NOT a real wine you recognize, or the input is too vague

Do NOT give high confidence just because you can fill in fields with plausible regional data.
If the producer name doesn't match a real winery you know, confidence must be LOW (<50).
Pattern matching (e.g., "Ch." = Château) is NOT enough for high confidence - the actual wine must exist.

Extract these fields (use null if not found or truly uncertain):
- producer: The winery/château/domaine name (only if it's a real producer you recognize)
- wineName: The wine's name. For single-wine estates (Opus One, Château Margaux, Screaming Eagle), set wineName = producer. Only use null if producer makes multiple wines and no specific wine is mentioned.
- vintage: The year (4 digits only)
- region: The specific wine region or appellation
- country: Country of origin
- wineType: One of: Red, White, Rosé, Sparkling, Dessert, Fortified
- grapes: Array of grape varieties (infer from region knowledge if needed)
- confidence: Your confidence 0-100 that this is a REAL, IDENTIFIABLE wine

Examples:
- "2019 Château Margaux" → producer: "Château Margaux", wineName: "Château Margaux", vintage: "2019", region: "Margaux", country: "France", wineType: "Red", grapes: ["Cabernet Sauvignon", "Merlot"], confidence: 95
- "Opus One 2018" → producer: "Opus One", wineName: "Opus One", vintage: "2018", region: "Napa Valley", country: "USA", wineType: "Red", grapes: ["Cabernet Sauvignon", "Merlot"], confidence: 90
- "Ch. something red 2018" → producer: null, wineName: null, vintage: "2018", region: null, country: null, wineType: "Red", grapes: null, confidence: 15 (not a real wine)
- "red wine" → producer: null, vintage: null, region: null, country: null, wineType: "Red", grapes: null, confidence: 10
